Exercise 01: ft_print_alphabet
Delivery directory: ex01/ 
Files to deliver: ft_print_alphabet.c 
Authorized functions: write
-------------------------------------
• Write a function that displays the lowercase alphabet on a single line in ascending order, starting from the letter "a".
• The prototype of the function should be as follows:
void ft_print_alphabet(void);
-------------------------------------

Pay attention to what is requested, only one file to deliver, a function, what means no main is allowed and only write function is permitted. 

For this function, we need the library unistd to be included. 

A function to print the alphabet can be coded in many ways. 
In this code, a char variable called `letter`is used to iterate in a while loop. 
The char variable is initialised with the first value 'a'. 
It is written in single quotes to refer the ASCII value of `a`, in this way, we make sure the `a` value in ASCII will be interpreted by the computer.
We initiate the while loop with the condition letter <= 'z' to set up the last letter to be printed. 
letter++ : one value is added to the variable letter to print the next letter of the alphabet.
