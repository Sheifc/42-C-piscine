Exercise 00: ft_putchar
Delivery directory: ex00/ 
Files to deliver: ft_putchar.c 
Authorized functions: write
------------------------------
• Write a function that displays the character used as a parameter.
• The prototype of the function should be as follows:
void ft_putchar(char c);

To display the character, you will need to use the write function as follows.
write(1, &c, 1);
-----------------------------

#include <unistd.h> : this includes the library `unistd.h` which is needed to use the function write requested. 

The write function has 3 parameters: 
-First parameter: 
0 : standard input
1 : standard output
2 : standard error
It will be used always 1 at the C piscine. 
-Second parameter: 
A pointer to a buffer of at least nbytes bytes, which will be written to the file. It means, a pointer to the data you want to write. 
-Third parameter: 
Number of bytes to write. If smaller than the provided buffer, the output is truncated.
