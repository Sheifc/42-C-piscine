Exercise 05: ft_print_comb
Files to deliver: ft_print_comb.c
Delivery directory: ex05/ 
Authorized functions: write
---------------------------------
• Write a function that displays, in ascending order, all possible combinations of three distinct digits in ascending order - yes, repetition is voluntary.
• The result is something like this:

$>./a.out | cat -e
012, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017, 018, 019, 023, ..., 789$>

• 987 is not included because 789 already exists
• 999 is not included because this number does not exclusively contain distinct digits
• The prototype of the function should be as follows:
void ft_print_comb(void);
----------------------------------

Prototype: 
First void: output of the function is void, nothing. 
Second void: input of the function is void, nothing.
