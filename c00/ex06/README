Exercise 06: ft_print_comb2 
Files to deliver: ft_print_comb2.c

Authorized functions: write
----------------------------------
• Write a function that displays all possible combinations of two numbers (XX XX) between 0 and 99, in ascending order.
• The result is something like this:

$>./a.out | cat -e
00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05, ..., 00 99, 01 02, ..., 97 99, 98 99$>

• The prototype of the function should be as follows:
void ft_print_comb2(void);

• Logic: 
--------
The logic of this exercise is based on breaking down the two numbers we need to print, separated by a space, 
keeping the first calculation with the first digit of the first number and the second digit with the second calculation.

For example, say we want to print 42, when we perform integer division by 10, the result is 4; we print this first digit. 
Then, when we take the remainder of 42 when divided by 10, we get 2, and we print it. 

Voila, we have printed the desired number.

• ASCII conversion: 
-------------------
`ft` function: when ft_putchar(a / 10 + '0') is used, what we are doing by adding '0', is to convert the number of the 
resulting division (a/10) to the value of that number in ASCII. 

When 0 is in quotes like this, the computer interprets the value of that number in ASCII which in this case is 48. 

ASCII table is included in this project to check this. 

Therefore, when you add the number resulting by the division of (a/10) to 48, let's say a=10, then 10/10=1, so, 48+1=49
which is the value in ASCII of number 1.
