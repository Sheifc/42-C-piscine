Exercise 06: ft_print_comb2 
Files to deliver: ft_print_comb2.c
Delivery directory: ex06/ 
Authorized functions: write
----------------------------------
• Write a function that displays all possible combinations of two numbers (XX XX) between 0 and 99, in ascending order.
• The result is something like this:

$>./a.out | cat -e
00 01, 00 02, 00 03, 00 04, 00 05, ..., 00 99, 01 02, ..., 97 99, 98 99$>

• The prototype of the function should be as follows:
void ft_print_comb2(void);

• ASCII conversion: 
-------------------
`ft` function: when ft_putchar(a / 10 + '0') is used, what we are doing by adding '0', is to convert the number of the 
resulting division (a/10) to the value of that number in ASCII. 

When 0 is in quotes like this, the computer interprets the value of that number in ASCII which in this case is 48. 

ASCII table is included in this project to check this. 

Therefore, when you add the number resulting by the division of (a/10) to 48, let's say a=10, then 10/10=1, so, 48+1=49
which is the value in ASCII of number 1.
